# Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"



class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        String[] words = s.split("\\s+");
        reverseArray(words);
        return String.join(" ", words);

        
    }
private void reverseArray(String[] arr) {
        int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            String temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
